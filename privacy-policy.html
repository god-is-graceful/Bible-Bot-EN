      <h1>Privacy Policy for Bible Discord Bot</h1>
      <p>Last updated: 26.09.2024</p>
      <p>Thank you for using the <b>Bible</b> Discord Bot. This Privacy Policy outlines how the bot collects, uses, and protects the information it gathers from users and servers on the Discord platform. By using the bot, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Information collected and usage:</p>
          <p>1.1 Server IDs and channel IDs: The bot does not collect and does not store server and channel IDs.</p>
          <p>1.2 Message processing: The bot processes messages sent within the server to check for Bible verse references. However, it's important to note that the bot does not store the content of the messages or any personal data related to users. The message processing is done in real-time, and no data is retained or stored beyond the duration of the processing.</p>
          <p>1.3 User IDs and choice of Bible translation: If a user voluntarily uses the "/setversion" or "/settimezone" command, the bot will store the user's Discord ID along with their selected Bible version preference and/or timezone. This information is used only to provide the user with full access to the bot's functions.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Data security:</p>
          <p>2.1 Data storage: The collected user's Discord IDs are securely stored on the databases. All reasonable measures are taken to prevent unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of this information.</p>
          <p>2.2 Data deletion: Users who wish to delete their stored data can do so by using the "/removeuserdata" command. Upon executing this command, the bot will permanently delete the user's Discord ID and associated Bible version and timezone from its databases.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Third-Party services:</p>
          <p>3.1 Discord API: The bot operates on the Discord platform and utilizes the Discord API to function properly. As a result, Discord’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Service also apply to the use of the bot.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Changes to the Privacy Policy:</p>
          <p>4.1 The Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in the bot’s functionalities or legal requirements. The most current version of the Privacy Policy will be made available and will become effective immediately upon posting.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>By using the <b>Bible</b> Discord Bot, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy and consent to the collection and use of information as described herein.</p>
